    <p class="instruction">Answer a questionnaire about all of your personal finances and upload your pay stubs from the last 60 days, if you were employed (2 hours).</p>

<p class="instruction">Take an online Credit Counseling course, known as Course 1, and get the required certificate. You need this certificate to file your forms. This course costs $14.95 and is offered by another nonprofit that&rsquo;s not Upsolve, but we give you the link that you should use. We show you how to get a fee waiver if you qualify. We automatically get the course certificate and attach it to your bankruptcy forms. (1 hour)</p>
</div>

<div class="walkthrough__item">
<p class="number"><span>4</span></p>
<p class="instruction">Come back to our site and choose a filing date, which tells us when you plan to file your forms. You can file your forms whenever you want, and the Court knows nothing about your filing date. Your filing date just helps you and Upsolve make a plan for when you intend to file.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="walkthrough__item">

<p class="instruction">Wait 5 days, as we generate your bankruptcy forms and an in-house Upsolve attorney reviews your forms for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<div class="walkthrough__item">
<p class="number"><span>6</span></p>
<p class="instruction">When we&rsquo;re done reviewing your forms, you&rsquo;ll get an email notification to log back into my.upsolve.org. You&rsquo;ll be able to download and print your forms. You may have to print multiple copies.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<p class="instruction">You need to deliver your forms to the nearest bankruptcy court. You deliver your forms to the Clerk&rsquo;s Office at the bankruptcy court. It&rsquo;s always a good idea to deliver the forms in person if you can, so you guarantee the court accepts them. If you&rsquo;re way too far to deliver your forms in person, you can mail them. You should always call the Clerk&rsquo;s Office ahead of time to find out specific instructions.</p>

<p class="instruction">Special payment instructions:</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<ul>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re paying the full $335 filing fee at once, make sure to have the cash ready to give to the Clerk&rsquo;s Office all at once.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re paying in installments, make sure to have your first installment payment ready. You should bring at least $100 to file, as some courts don&rsquo;t let you make less than a $100 first installment.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re applying for a fee waiver, Upsolve includes the fee waiver at the end of your packet of forms. It&rsquo;s there, we promise. Your fee waiver may be denied, in which case you&rsquo;ll have to pay in installments. Make sure to be alert to see if your fee waiver is denied. Some people get their case dismissed because they weren&rsquo;t aware their fee waiver was denied.</li>
</ul>

<p class="instruction">Once you file your forms, you will get three important things:</p>
<div class="clearfix"></div>
<ul>
	<li>The name of your Trustee and their contact information.</li>
	<li>Direction on what to send to your Trustee. They may request bank statements, your tax returns, your pay stubs, etc. You need to send them all this info ahead of your 341 meeting, or your case will be dismissed.</li>
	<li>Your 341 Meeting Date</li>
</ul>

<p class="instruction">Your trustee is the court official who oversees your case. You will meet with them about one month after you file your forms. Make sure you save the date of that meeting. If you can&rsquo;t make it, contact your Trustee to reschedule. If you miss this meeting, your case will be dismissed.</p>
</div>
<div class="clearfix"></div>

<p class="instruction">Mail or email all the documents to your trustee that he requests. These will include the last two years of tax returns. They also likely include your pay stubs, bank statements, car title, etc. Make sure to send your trustee everything they ask for!</p>
</div>

<div class="walkthrough__item">
<p class="number"><span>10</span></p>
<p class="instruction">Take Course 2 online, using our link. This course is a lot like Course 1, and it costs $9.95 but you may be able to get a fee waiver. When you&rsquo;re done, you must save your certificate, print it, and file it with the court. Upsolve doesn&rsquo;t file your Course 2 certificate for you. You should file your certificate with the Clerk&rsquo;s Office the same day as your 341 Meeting, so that you don&rsquo;t forget to do it later. Some people get their case dismissed because they forget to file their Course 2 certificate.</p>

<p class="instruction">Watch the 341 meeting prep video we made for you at my.upsolve.org. This will prepare you for your 5-minute 341 meeting with your trustee.</p>

<p class="number"><span>12</span></p>

<p class="instruction">Attend your 341 meeting. Your trustee may say that your case is closed at the end of it, and you won&rsquo;t have to do anything else. You will receive official notice of your debts being erased about two months later in the mail. Your trustee may tell you to make changes to your forms and come back at another date, in which case you should do exactly what they tell you.</p>
